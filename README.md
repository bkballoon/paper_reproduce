This code includes some implements of important from my point of view.
including:
1. "A new mesh visual quality metric using saliency weighting-based pooling strategy"
2. "Salient Region of Textured 3D Model"
3. "Mesh saliency via spectral processing"
4. "Surface simplification using quadric error metrics"
5. "Variational Shape Approximation"
6. "Accurate Simplification of Multi-Chart Textured Models" which is dong.
